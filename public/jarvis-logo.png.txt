This is a placeholder for the PNG version of the JARVIS logo. In a real implementation, this would be a rendered PNG file of the SVG logo.
The SVG logo features:
- A dark background with a radial gradient
- A hexagonal shape representing AI/core intelligence with a neon blue-purple glow
- An inner circle representing connectivity/data
- Neon glowing text spelling "JARVIS"
- Small particle effects around the logo
- Cyberpunk/futuristic aesthetic with glassmorphism elements

For production use, the SVG should be rendered to PNG at multiple resolutions:
- 16x16 for favicons
- 32x32 for small icons
- 64x64 for medium icons
- 128x128 for larger displays
- 256x256 for high-resolution displays
- 512x512 for app icons
